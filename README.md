# Hi, I'm Micah

I live at <https://me.micahrl.com>, which hosts my blog, more information about my projects, other writing, etc.

Some highlights:

- [keymap.click](https://keymap.click) is a visual demonstration of how an ErgoDox-EZ keyboard helps me prevent pain from RSI. It's [my first React project](https://github.com/mrled/keymap.click), and I'm really proud of it.
- [biblemunger](http://biblemunger.micahrl.com) is an old project that lets you replace text in the Bible. It's an homage to some [hilarious writing](https://the-toast.net/2015/09/30/bible-verses-where-the-word-tithe-has-been-replaced-with-ass-grass-or-cash-nobody-rides-for-free/) from The (sadly defunct) Toast.
- [progfiguration](https://pages.micahrl.com/progfiguration/) is my imperative, programmatic configuration management system. Used to Ansible, and wish you could just write Python instead of YAML? That's what this is.
- [A writeup of an outage I caused](https://me.micahrl.com/blog/random-failure-problems-upgrading-ansible-python/)
- [A description of my COVID-era computer audio mixing system](https://me.micahrl.com/projects/deskmx/)
